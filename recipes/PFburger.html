    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a succulent juicy burger from Pulp Fiction</p><br>
    <p>The Ingredients needed are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>4 seeded hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices American Cheese</li>
        <li>1 beefsteak tomato, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds</li>
        <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
        <li>Shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>ketchup or other condiments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Preheat grill for direct-heat cooking. Gently form beef into 4 patties, each 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick (do not overwork meat or patties will be tough). Season generously with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise onto the cut sides of each bun.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Place patties on grill and cook, uncovered, until browned and sizzling on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, top each with a slice of cheese, cover grill, and cook until cheese is melted and patties are medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Place buns on grill cut-side down; cook just until lightly toasted and golden brown in places, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Dress the cut side of each bottom bun with ketchup and mayonnaise (or desired condiments), then top with patties. Place a tomato slice on top of each patty and season with salt. Stack with pickles and lettuce. Dress cut side of top buns with condiments, then sandwich toppings and serve.</li>
    </ol>
